A Thesis Project using MATLAB and OpenCV

üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on improving household surveillance by integrating facial deblurring with facial recognition techniques. Blurred images captured by security cameras can hinder accurate recognition, so this system enhances image clarity before performing facial recognition.

Key Features

‚úÖ Facial Deblurring ‚Äì Enhances low-quality or blurred facial images for better recognition.

‚úÖ Facial Recognition ‚Äì Identifies and verifies individuals using machine learning techniques.

‚úÖ MATLAB & OpenCV Integration ‚Äì Utilizes MATLAB for algorithm development and OpenCV for image processing.

‚úÖ Household Surveillance Application ‚Äì Designed to improve security by enhancing facial recognition accuracy in real-world scenarios.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

‚Ä¢	Programming Languages: MATLAB, Python

‚Ä¢	Libraries & Frameworks:

‚Ä¢	OpenCV (for image processing)

‚Ä¢	MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox

üìå Use Cases

‚Ä¢	Home Security Systems: Enhance CCTV footage for better identification of individuals.
‚Ä¢	Smart Door Access: Improve facial recognition accuracy for secure entry systems.
‚Ä¢	Forensic Applications: Restore and identify faces in low-quality surveillance footage.
